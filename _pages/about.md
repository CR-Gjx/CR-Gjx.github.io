- I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at The University of Sydney, advised by Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html) and Doctor [Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/).

- I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/).

- My current research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in causal learning, reinforcement learning and domain adaptation methods, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, computer vision and natural language processing.
